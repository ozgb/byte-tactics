"""List matched functions named as free functions that are probably methods.

    uv run tools/methods.py

A function whose callers load `ecx` just before every call to it is almost
always a `__thiscall` method, even when its own body never reads `ecx` (an
empty method, or one that ignores `this`). Naming it as a free function makes
every caller that is decompiled later fail the name check, so these are worth
renaming before anyone else trips over them. Prints each suspect with its
current name, how many call sites set `ecx`, and its file.
