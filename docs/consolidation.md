# Consolidation notes

Things to resolve when the per-function files in `src/unsorted/` are merged
into real classes and translation units. Agents name unknown classes after
single addresses, so one real class often appears under several names.

## Classes to merge

- `Class_0044cf60` and `Class_0044d010`: both constructors store vtable
  `DAT_004fd328` and fill the same fields (+8 packed point, +0xc radius,
  +0x10 radius squared). Probably overloaded constructors of one class.
- `Class_004c91a0` (copy constructor, 0x4c91a0), `Class_004c9390` (destructor:
  decrement and free, 0x4c9390) and `Class_004c93b0` (assignment,
  0x4c93b0) are the same reference-counted string handle.
- `Class_00485e30` (vtable 0x4fd698, created by 0x485d40) derives from
  `Class_004b0610`; its 20 overrides (0x480770-0x481470) are matched under
  separate placeholder classes. 0x485e30.cpp keeps a static `new` to emit its
  `??_G` until 0x485d40 is decompiled. The run 0x4b0720-0x4b1c00 is probably
  more non-virtual methods of `Class_004b0610` (0x485d40 calls 0x4b0940).
- `Class_00470ae0` (vtable 0x4fd580, `??_G` at 0x470ae0): its constructor is
  0x470a90 (`Class_00470a90::FUN_00470a90`) and its destructor 0x470b80
  (`Class_00470b80::FUN_00470b80`).
- `Class_0044e250` and `Class_0044e330`: two constructors storing vtable
  `DAT_004fd3b8`.
- Functions that store the same vtable address belong to the same class (or a
  base/derived pair); a tool listing every vtable store would find the rest.

## Duplicated library code

- Two copies of `std::_Lockit` (0x4e39b0 and 0x4e1480) and its cleanup are
  linked in; `data/aliases.csv` maps both. The code at 0x4d8000-0x4e3000 that
  calls the second copy is probably a separately built library.

## Context-dependent functions

- 0x4581e0 and 0x4335e0 match only with a header block (`windows.h`, `stdio.h`,
  `string.h`, `math.h`) at the top; 0x4d1820 and 0x438650 still differ in one
  operand order. Their original translation units probably decide this.

## Matches that use suspicious constructs

These match byte-for-byte but use something Cavedog probably did not write;
revisit them once the surrounding code is known.


- The `std` exception classes in the C++ library block were misnamed by the
  signature matcher (their destructors are identical apart from the vtable).
  By RTTI: vtable 0x4fdca4 is `std::logic_error` (0x4c3730 is `what`, 0x4c38a0
  is `??1logic_error`), 0x4fdcb4 is `std::out_of_range` (0x4c3aa0 `??1`,
  0x4c3af0 `_Doraise`, 0x4c3c60 `??_G`), 0x4fdc7c is `std::length_error`.

- The 0x4fc980 family is consolidated (table in 0x407350.cpp): base
  `Class_00407350` and six derived classes, one per 2-slot vtable, owned by
  `Class_00408cb0`. `Class_004079d0` and `Class_00408810` are not yet named
  after their constructors (0x4079a0, 0x4087e0); 0x407d40 (a constructor) is
  unmatched at about 78%, its vtable stored between two vector computations.
- 0x417a60 (the debug crash command) divides by `(one >> 1)` with
  `volatile int one = 1`; plausible for a deliberate crash, but check once
  its file's other functions are known.

- The 0x4fd428 family is consolidated (table in 0x44ef60.cpp): base
  `Class_0044ef20`, derived `Class_0044f010`, `Class_0044f570`, middle
  `Class_00490630` and its children `Class_004907e0`, `Class_00490880`.
  Left over: 0x490880.cpp uses the name `Class_00490880` for what is
  `Class_004907e0`'s slot 2 override; 0x44f010.cpp and 0x44f570.cpp store their
  vtables by hand; 0x44ef90's class is spelt `Class_44ef90`.

- The timer class is `Class_004e2150` in 0x4e2150.cpp and `Class_004e2160`
  elsewhere; its getter 0x4e1e30 is `Class_004e1e30::FUN_004e1e30`.
- 0x434360.cpp's `Elem_00434360` looks like `std::vector<Elem_00434020>`: the
  operator= it calls (0x434770) destroys elements with 0x433a30, which is
  `~vector<Elem_00434020>`. So 0x434360 is probably an erase on a three-level
  vector, and 0x434770's recorded name is one level too shallow. Evidence
  since: with `Elem_00434360` as a struct holding a `vector<Elem_00434020>`,
  a rebuilt 0x434770 is byte-identical (0x4349f0.cpp), but it then calls
  0x434470 and 0x4349c0 under names other than their recorded ones
  (`Elem_004349c0` and `Elem_00434020` look like one 4-byte type).

- `Class_004402e0` (constructor 0x4402e0) is the class 0x440290.cpp calls
  `Class_00440320`, while 0x440320 is recorded as the free function
  `FUN_00440320`.

- `Class_0046e4d0::FUN_0046e4d0` and `Class_0046e450` are the same object's
  class (both called on g_game+0x2a30 from the two arms of one branch at
  0x44c4f8).
- 0x4352d0, 0x463730 and 0x45ca50 have no callers and no pointers to them:
  probably dead code.

- 0x438b90's `Class_00438b90` has `Class_0043a1f0`'s layout (kind at +4,
  flags at +0x42).

- `Class_00415b60`, `Class_00415b90` and `Class_00415c10` are one bit-writer
  class (0x48b710 calls all three on one 0x410-byte stack object).


- The 0x4fd5a8 family is consolidated (table in 0x471cc0.cpp): base
  `Class_00471cc0` (destructor 0x471d00, class `operator new` 0x471d10 and
  `operator delete` 0x471d50) and six derived classes. Left over: the slot
  methods keep their placeholder classes (0x472f90 is still
  `Class_00472fd0::FUN_00472f90`); 0x471d70 is a non-virtual base method;
  0x475330 is recorded as a free function but is slot 3 of `Class_004750b0`;
  four derived `??_G` files use a static `new` until the real `new` sites
  (0x471340 and others) are decompiled; the pool at DAT_0051e610 is
  `Class_00470ed0`/`Class_00470eb0` in some files and `Class_00470ae0` in
  0x470ae0.cpp.

- The victory condition with vtables 0x4fd890 (primary) and 0x4fd888 (visitor
  base) is `Class_0048f250`; its slots 4 and 5 (0x48f2f0, 0x48f330) are still
  filed as `Class_0048f2f0` and `Class_0048f330`.
- **A probable Cavedog bug** (see docs/bugs.md): the bit writer grows its buffer with `new
  unsigned int(capacity * 2)` (one dword initialised to the size) where an
  array was surely meant (0x415bb0, inlined in 0x415c10).

- Overloads share one name in data/symbols.csv, so the string handle's
  constructors are split across `Class_004c9180` (default), `Class_004c91a0`
  (copy) and `Class_004c91b0` (`const char*`); the timer's two constructors
  both use `Class_004e1d20::Class_004e1d20`, which the checker cannot tell apart.

- The `Class_0044ce20` family (vtables around 0x4fd3f8, constructors 0x44e740
  and 0x44e9c0 among others) still stores its vtables by hand
  (`vtable = DAT_004fd3f8;`), like the 0x4fc980 family before its
  consolidation.

- 0x43c360 is `vector::size()` of the global vector of 25-byte records at
  0x512340 but is named `Class_0043c360::FUN_0043c360`; it will clash when
  0x43bc90 or 0x43c050 is decompiled with a real `std::vector`.
- 0x44ec00 is a vtable slot of `Class_0044e740` recorded as a free function;
  tools/methods.py can't see it because it is only called through the vtable.

## Signatures that disagree

The checker compares names, not parameter types, so callers and definitions
can disagree on types (a real link would fail). Known cases:

- `FUN_004ba590`: its file takes `int`; callers such as 0x417290 pass `float`.
- `FUN_004d0620`: its file returns `void`; 0x47efe0 uses a `void*` result.
- `Class_00438b90::FUN_00438b90` takes the 1-byte class `Class_00438760` by value
  (see 0x403190); its own file declares `int k`. FUN_0043f0e0 returns the same
  class through a hidden buffer.
- `FUN_004d83b0` returns a pointer (0x481500) but its file says `void`.
- `Class_0043a0c0`'s constructor: 0x43a020 and 0x43b730 declare its first
  parameter `unsigned char`, but 0x401c20 shows it is a 1-byte class passed by
  value, built by `Class_00438760::Class_00438760`.

## Third-party code

- zlib 1.0.4 occupies 0x4d1c80-0x4d7d70 and matches from its own source with
  `/Gz /Zp1`; 5 of its 58 functions (inlined statics or variants) did not match
  and are still listed as game code around that range. A rebuild should compile
  the real zlib source rather than decompiled copies.

## Per-file compiler options

- Some original files were compiled with `/Gz` (`__stdcall` by default): STL
  templates there (`copy_backward`, `fill`, `_Construct`, sort helpers around
  0x43c6b0-0x43cb20 and 0x4c5bc0-0x4c5d10) end in `ret N`. The staged files
  write those as explicit `__stdcall` functions; when files are regrouped, those
  translation units should get `/Gz` and the real `std::` templates instead.
