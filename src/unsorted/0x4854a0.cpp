// Decompiled by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash. Names are provisional.
// NOT a match: 80.2% (1208 bytes against 1180). The pool setup, the inlined
// std::sort over the ten player pointers and the free-list linking all have the
// right shape. What still differs:
//  - FUN_00485940 is DEFINED here (not just declared) so MSVC inlines it at the
//    direct compare sites; that alone took the score from 57.6% to 80.2%. The
//    out-of-line helpers (FUN_00488920 / 60 / 810) still take it by pointer.
//  - the pool local is kept in ebx; the original keeps it in ebp.
//  - call-cleanup: our std::_Sort / std::_Unguarded_partition calls are made
//    __cdecl (extra `add esp`); the original TU was compiled with __stdcall as
//    the default (/Gz). Re-checking with /Gz scores 78.5%, so the default flags
//    are still the better base and the sort tails need to be hand-written with
//    explicit __stdcall helper declarations (see src/unsorted/0x43bc90.cpp).
//  - the free-list linking loop keeps slot/end in different registers and the
//    compiler folds q+0xff into the addressing where the original uses a plain
//    cursor.
